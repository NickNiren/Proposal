# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Gonki

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A top down racing game where the track is procedurally generated and you're racing against AI opponents.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We are using Pygame to create a top down racing game where the goal is to avoid the obstacles as well as stay on the track for as long as possible. The game ends when you hit either a rock or other obstacle, run off the track, or hit another vehical. Once the game ends your score is calculated based on your survival time. The longer you play, the harder the game gets. This will be done by making the obstacles move faster.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A fun racing game where you have to avoid objects flying at you at high speeds. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Falling obstacles
- Randomly generated track

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Falling obstacles
- Randomly generated track
- AI opponenets

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to learn more about pygame to successfully complete this project. We will also need to learn how to work in a group to complete this project in a timely manner. We will both focus on different aspects of the code, depedning on who has a stronger skillset in that area.
